      <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are marine
        <a href="https://google.com/search?q=molluscs">molluscs</a> of the order
        Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda, which also includes
        squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal
        shell, the cuttlebone, which is used for control of buoyancy. Cuttlefish
        have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished
        with denticulated suckers, with which they secure their prey. They
        generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest
        species, Sepia apama, reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over
        10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass.[3]

      <h2>Fossil record</h2>
      The earliest fossils of cuttlefish are from the Cretaceous period.[6][7]
      represented by Ceratisepia from the Late Maastrichtian-Paleocene.[8]
      Whether the earlier Trachyteuthis is assigned to this order, or to the
      Octopodiformes, remains unclear.[9]

      <h2>Range and habitat</h2>
      <p>
        S. mestus swimming (Australia) The family Sepiidae, which contains all
        cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and temperate ocean waters. They are
        mostly shallow-water animals, although they are known to go to depths of
        about 600 m (2,000 ft).[10] They have an unusual biogeographic pattern;
        they are present along the coasts of East and South Asia, Western
        Europe, and the Mediterranean, as well as all coasts of Africa and
        Australia, but are totally absent from the Americas. By the time the
        family evolved, ostensibly in the Old World, the North Atlantic possibly
        had become too cold and deep for these warm-water species to cross.[11]
        The common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), is found in the
        Mediterranean, North and Baltic seas, although populations may occur as
        far south as South Africa. They are found in sublittoral depths, between
        the low tide line and the edge of the continental shelf, to about 180 m
        (600 ft).[12] The cuttlefish is listed under the Red List category of
        "least concern" by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This means
        that while some over-exploitation of the marine animal has occurred in
        some regions due to large-scale commercial fishing, their wide
        geographic range prevents them from being too threatened. Ocean
        acidification, however, caused largely by higher levels of carbon
        dioxide emitted into the atmosphere, is cited as a potential threat.[13]

      <h2>Anatomy and physiology</h2>
      <p>
        Visual system The characteristic W-shape of the cuttlefish eye
        File:Sepia eyelid shape.theora.ogv Pupil expansion in Sepia officinalis
        Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes. The
        organogenesis and the final structure of the cephalopod eye
        fundamentally differ from those of vertebrates such as humans.[14]
        Superficial similarities between cephalopod and vertebrate eyes are
        thought to be examples of convergent evolution. The cuttlefish pupil is
        a smoothly curving W-shape.[15][16] Although cuttlefish cannot see
        color,[17] they can perceive the polarization of light, which enhances
        their perception of contrast. They have two spots of concentrated sensor
        cells on their retinas (known as foveae), one to look more forward, and
        one to look more backward. The eye changes focus by shifting the
        position of the entire lens with respect to the retina, instead of
        reshaping the lens as in mammals. Unlike the vertebrate eye, no blind
        spot exists, because the optic nerve is positioned behind the retina.
        They are capable of using stereopsis, enabling them to discern
        depth/distance because their brain calculates the input from both
        eyes.[18][19] The cuttlefish's eyes are thought to be fully developed
        before birth, and they start observing their surroundings while still in
        the egg. In consequence, they may prefer to hunt the prey they saw
        before hatching.[20] Circulatory system The blood of a cuttlefish is an
        unusual shade of green-blue, because it uses the copper-containing
        protein haemocyanin to carry oxygen instead of the red, iron-containing
        protein haemoglobin found in vertebrates' blood. The blood is pumped by
        three separate hearts: two branchial hearts pump blood to the
        cuttlefish's pair of gills (one heart for each), and the third pumps
        blood around the rest of the body. Cuttlefish blood must flow more
        rapidly than that of most other animals because haemocyanin carries
        substantially less oxygen than haemoglobin. Unlike most other mollusks,
        cephalopods like cuttlefish have a closed circulatory system.[21]
