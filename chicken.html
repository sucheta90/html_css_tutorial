        The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated bird, with attributes
        of wild species such as the red and grey junglefowl[1] that are
        originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an
        adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male
        that has been castrated is a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capon">capon </a>. An adult
        female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a
        pullet. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies,
        chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd
        centuries BC).[2][3] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of
        food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets. Chickens are one
        of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total
        population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[4] up from more than 19 billion
        in 2011.[5] There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.[5]
        There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore
        and religion, and in language and literature. Genetic studies have
        pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and
        East Asia,[6] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle
        East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient
        India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece
        by the 5th century BC.[7] Fowl have been known in Egypt since the
        mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having
        come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the
        annals of Thutmose III.[8][9][10]
